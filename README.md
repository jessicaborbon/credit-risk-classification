## Credit-risk Analysis with Logistic Regression Model

### Supervised Machine learning
## Overview of the Analysis
For this project, I worked with a dataset from a lending platform that recorded historical lending activity. 

The dataset included:
Key features like loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts held by the borrower, the number of derogatory remarks, and the borrowerâ€™s total debt. 

The label, or target variable, was the loan status, which indicates whether the loan was repaid or defaulted. 

## Dependencies used:
Scikit Learn and Pandas

## Model Design Process
1. Data Input
2. Split Data - test data
3. Model Training -test data
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Deployment

## The result
* The classification report which takes into account the model's accuracy revealed that the healthy loans had a precision score of 100%, and a recall of 99%. For the non-healthy loans, the precision and recall were 84% and 99%, respectively. The overall performance of the model was calculated to be 99%.

* From the confusion matrix (Fig. 1) the logistic model predicted 18,663 as healthy loans correctly and 110 as healthy loans incorrectly from a total loan status of 18,655 which were healthy (i.e., low-risk).
* The model predicted 583 as high-risk loans correctly and 36 high-risk loans incorrectly from a total loan status of 619 which were high-risk.


### Summary
Using this information, I built a model aimed at predicting the creditworthiness of borrowers.

This model helps lenders gauge the risk of lending to a specific borrower, determine appropriate interest rates, and make informed decisions about whether to approve a loan. 

By utilizing historical borrower data and analyzing various financial factors, lenders can estimate the likelihood of default, leading to more reliable lending choices.
